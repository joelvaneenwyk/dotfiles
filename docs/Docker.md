# Troubleshooting

I've been successfully using Docker for years and then it just stopped working
some days ago. One potential issue was that I ran out of hard-drive space at one
point but have recovered since.

- Now have plenty of hard-drive space.
- Uninstalled and removed all files from here:
  - `C:\ProgramData\Docker`
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Docker`
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\DockerDesktop`
  - `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Docker`
  - `%USERPROFILE%\.docker`
- Reinstalled and same issue.

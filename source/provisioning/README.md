This repository is the home of a set of bash scripts that enable and configure an enhanced session mode on Linux VMs (Ubuntu, arch) for Hyper-V.

## How to use the repo

You can find the original instructions here: [Ubuntu 20.04 on Hyper-V. Creating Virtual Machine | by App Engineering Lab | Medium](https://medium.com/@labappengineering/ubuntu-20-04-on-hyper-v-8888fe3ced64)

There is also some useful information about display settings at [Donovan Brown | How to run HyperV base Ubuntu VM full screen](https://www.donovanbrown.com/post/How-to-run-HyperV-base-Ubuntu-VM-full-screen).

```bash
# Follow https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/virtualization/sneak-peek-taking-a-spin-with-enhanced-linux-vms/ba-p/382415
# xrdp.service not starting because address already in use: https://github.com/microsoft/linux-vm-tools/issues/94

# Get the scripts from GitHub
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/joelvaneenwyk/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles/source/provisioning/ubuntu/18.04/

#Make the scripts executable and run them...
sudo chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
sudo reboot
cd ~/linux-vm-tools/ubuntu/18.04/
sudo ./install.sh
sudo systemctl enable xrdp.service
sudo gedit /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini
# change these two lines: port=vsock://-1:3389 and use_vsock=false
sudo systemctl start xrdp.service
sudo shutdown -h 0
```

Once you execute the above, run the following in PowerShell with administrator privileges.

```powershell
Set-VM -VMName <your_vm_name>  -EnhancedSessionTransportType HvSocket
```
